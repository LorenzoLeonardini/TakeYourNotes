# Take your Notes

This program will help you take notes in a fast, fashionable way by using MarkDown. Why markdown? Because it's incredibly easy to learn and fast to write!
You wont be limited in any way! Check out [how this library works](https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/easyHtmlGoogleCharts) and you will be able to insert Google charts in your notes. You wont need to wait a lot for another library that allows you to easily insert the GeoGebra plotter as well! 

Take your Notes support any type of programming language highlight throwgh the [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org) library.

Just use this syntax

&#96;&#96;&#96;cpp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
&#96;&#96;&#96;

As you can notice `cpp` defines which language is written into that block of code. This allows highlight.js not to get confused and to produce the correct result

```cpp
	std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
```

At the moment Take your Notes is only a Markdown reader, I just need some time to implement an editor too.

Test the reader by opening a .md file *(Ctrl+O)* or a folder containing various .md files linked btw themselves *(Ctrl+Shift+O)* **notice that that folder needs a index.md file**

Look at [TODO.md](../TODO.md) to know which features are intended but not yet implemented
